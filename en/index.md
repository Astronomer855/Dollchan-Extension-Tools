**Dollchan Extension Tools** (also called "dollscript") is the userscript that combines many various features, making you hang out on [imageboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard) in an easier and more convenient way.

The script has both cross-browser and cross-board working scope. A list of supported sites includes all imageboards based on wakaba, kusaba, their derivatives, or any other board engine that generates a html source parsable by the script, implying no critical changes were made by board maintainers. Otherwise, the script will either block itself or will not work correctly.

* [Supported imageboards](supported-image-boards)
* [Script installation](installation)
* [Dollchan API](dollchan-api)
* [Spells guide](spells)
* [Time correction guide](settings-time)
* [CSS tricks](css-tricks)
